# xcode-shortcuts

This repository is meant to contain an overview of the most important keyboard shortcuts for Xcode 11 and later. Perhaps later there will be versions for different keyboard layouts, as the default shortcuts are designed to work with a QWERTY (en_US) layout.

The current state can be found here: 
* [en_US shortcuts (Markdown)](./shortcuts_en.md)
* [en_US shortcuts (layouted PDF)](./Shortcuts_en.pdf)
